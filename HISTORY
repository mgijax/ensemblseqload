CHANGES: I realized that the associatins were only getting redone
  when reloading sequences, thus the following changes:
1) vega_ensemblseqload.sh - added processing of second parameter
   a boolean indicating to load sequences and assocs when true, 
   only assocs when false
2) VegaEnsemblSeqloadCfg - added boolean getLoadSeqs()
3) VegaEnsemblSeqloader - added checking for boolean and processing 
   accordingly.
